Machine Learning: Support vector machine with sklearn python

In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that
analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. [more about it..](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)

Here we have a dataset of apple stokes, here we will predicted prices of apple stokes with help of SMV  SVM have concept of kernal
so we will see the result for different kernel in SVM , eg: (116.54989732432711, 126.32909091568206, 123.47226857310375)
